                        Have fun with it. Just beat the devil out of it. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. 
                        Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. We artists are a different 
                        breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Let all these things just sort of happen. If we're gonna walk though 
                        the woods, we need a little path. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of 
                        your painting and get your floor wet. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. I'm 
                        gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.
                        Let's build some happy little clouds up here. There comes a nice little fluffer. You can do anything here - 
                        the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be.Get 
                        tough with it, get strong. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. The shadows are just like the 
                        highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. We 
                        don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. We'll do another happy little painting. Take your time. 
                        Speed will come later. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. You have to make almighty 
                        decisions when you're the creator. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. It's almost like something
                        out of a fairytale book. You are only limited by your imagination. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. 
                        In life you need colors. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. We'll put all the little clouds in and let 
                        them dance around and have fun. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Follow the 
                        lay of the land. It's most important. Anything you want to do you can do here. You can do anything your heart can 
                        imagine. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.
